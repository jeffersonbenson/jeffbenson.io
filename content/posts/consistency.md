I'm never really sure how to count Sundays in Lent. 

Traditionally, Sunday is a sort of "mini-Easter" where one is able to temporarily put down whatever they've given up as an act of celebration. That doesn't mean that the liturgy is any less penitential, on the contrary rather. Instead, it speaks to the idea of a foretaste of what is to come, and parts of the service are altered as a means of helping individuals look toward the Easter celebration as the main event. 

But it does become interesting for me, particularly during Lent, to think on how much things stay the same despite the change of season. I have found immense comfort in learning how God never changes by way of how the liturgy of His church doesn't really change.

When I'm feeling sad, the liturgy stays the same.

When I'm happy, the liturgy stays the same.

When I feel alone.

When I'm scared.

When things are great.

The liturgy doesn't change, because God doesn't change. 

I often have a tendency to express what I'm feeling as a demonstration of how someone else feels about me. If I'm feeling depressed, I often believe that it's because the people around me are the problem, not my own unresolved issues or disrupted brain chemistry. Further still, if I am in sin, I am quick to believe that it is the result of someone else's wrong against me, rather than my own fundamental belief, according to Oswald Chambers, "that God is not good". I fight and kick and scream (sometimes literally) as if I know a better way to run the show.

And yet, even in the midst of my own tantrums, God's love for me is still consistent. He loves me just as much in my moments of foolishness as He does when I'm at my best. 

I want to emulate that.

Side note: I got a Baofeng BF-F8HP ham radio in the mail today. While that might not mean much to a lot of people, it does pave the way for some exciting projects to come in the near future.
