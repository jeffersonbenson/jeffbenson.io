If the title wasn't obvious enough, today is my birthday, and I am officially the ripe old age of 27 years. While that doesn't seem like a lot of time, when you have someone asking you about the highlights of your past year, you realize just how much life can be crammed into a single solar rotation. 

The day started out like most others. I still had to work today despite it being my birthday (the nerve of some people), but quickly turned to running some morning errands and then hanging out with Miranda for the afternoon. Just the two of us went for a nice light dinner with drinks at the rooftop bar of a nearby fancy hotel, where we enjoyed the sunset across the Virginia sky. To many this would be a perfect evening, and you would be right. 

It's fascinating to me though, to think about how at this time last year there was a large group of people gathered at my house for a party. Yet this year it was just the two of us for a quiet dinner "like adults". 

I now think about the people that were gathered at that party last year. Many of them are still together in one form or another, while some have had to move on, and still others were encouraged to move on. Funny how much can happen in a year.

We returned from dinner to find that Miranda had prepared a surprise cake that we had candles for and everything. We enjoyed that with the family she lives with, and everything was super fantastic. The cake itself combined all of my favorite dessert concepts: chocolate, crunchy things, and peanut butter. Did I mention it somehow had no sugar added?

After a few bites of cake, the father of the household (a counselor by trade and my priest by calling) asked me what my favorite birthday memory was. Truth be told I'm sorry to report that I don't think I have one at the ready. I have a few sad memories from birthdays past, but none that directly involve a happy moment. This of course isn't to say I had a sad life, just that birthdays were often a more subdued affair in the Benson household, where a cake was cut and that was about it. 

It's been a while though, since I had a family surrounding me all singing "Happy Birthday". Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful for all of my friends who put a ton of effort into birthday parties. To them I'd say I couldn't ask for better friends. But I will say that the nostalgia of a simple birthday evening, with good food and good cake, truely warms my heart.

I don't know what the next year will hold, but if it's anything like what this last year has been, then bring it on!
