Today a dear friend of mine and his fianc√© announced they would be pushing their wedding up considerably due to concerns about a total lockdown. This is also the same friend of mine who told me that he wasn't incredibly concerned with the virus, or at least it's capacity to harm himself or his soon-to-be wife. Much of his family as I'm writing this is making the long journey across the country to be here for this momentous occasion.

Today, I was with Miranda and many of the members of a dear missionary-family our church has been praying for for years. They have had to accelerate their move to our area by about several months, and the husband, last I heard, was about to drive across the nation to reunite with his family and bring over all their stuff for their new house. This has all happened very quickly due to the concern of a mandated lockdown. 

Both of these stories though, concern more than just rearranged plans and the woes of moving. Rather, I would say these stories speak of family more than anything. About a young couple who wishes to be together and weather out the impending storm of sickness, and the people who are literally driving through a national crisis to be there for one another. It's about a father who rather than be separated from his family, has brought his family out to where he will be so that they can continue to be together in a time of possible calamity.

Families, even if they aren't always together, tend to be more bound physically when catastrophe strikes. It's the reason why when a family member goes into the hospital, there is a longing to be there even if you know you can't do anything. And often times you can't do anything (even if you're a trained medical professional). The only real thing that the soul desires in moments like that is to be together. Even just today my siblings and I stoked the fires of a forgotten group chat to catch up and discuss the games we would like to play together. Even though we are physically separated by many miles, our desire to cling to one another still remains strong. 

It is a fascinating time we're living in, and one of the potential benefits rests in having families gather who under normal circumstances would not be prone to gathering. Let us pray for peace in those homes as families relearn how to gather and be amongst one another.
