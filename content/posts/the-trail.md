So today I guess it technically the halfway point of this whole journey, and coincidentally enough today is also the first day of spring. Despite my rather rote day of more quarantine and normal work circumstances, I also had the opportunity to continue another habit that's been developing. For this past week, after work Miranda and I have had been walking on a small trail near her house, both as a way to catch up and to get out of our respective houses.

Along this trail there are several different landscapes. In the beginning there is a wide clearing with different paths towards homes and backyards, followed by a narrowing of the path alongside a river, and finally to a clean path through the woods that is ultimately backed by a nearby road, at which point we will turn around and walk the trail back. I've found this whole process very peaceful, and a good opportunity to stretch my legs after spending the whole day staring at a screen.

But it struck me today something that was mentioned a few days ago. You see when this season of Lent began, I don't believe we were expecting to be in the position we currently are in as a culture. It seems as if overnight the entire world has changed, and what was once certain is now very uncertain. And everything is continuing to move very quickly.

But on that trail, the trees continue to grow the same they always have. The squirrels and occasional deer don't seem to be too bothered. And the mountains are evermore unchanged. They aren't worried about what's going on outside the trail at all. Perhaps there is a lesson in that.

Wisdom is a virtue that one should hold close, but panic drives someone to do many unwise things. I have seen several accounts this week of those not loving their neighbors well, and I believe it is sourced from a growing panic about the unknown nature of tomorrow. But perhaps we should rejoice in the fact that the mountains aren't going anywhere, the trees are still growing, and much of the rest of creation is unbothered by not knowing what tomorrow holds. 

We should be wise to not only love our neighbors well in our actions and reactions, and take heart that the Creator of the Universe still allows a forest to thrive, even just so we can take a walk through it and be reminded of His presence.
