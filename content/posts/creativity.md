Once again, I believe I should have wrote yesterday, but it was already late when I had the opportunity to sit down, and I don't believe we're practicing that kind of suffering this Lent. 

More importantly, as was demonstrated earlier in my day, creativity is a muscle that must be worked out in order to be able to use it, particularly when you're called upon in a given moment to be creative. Such was me getting to work with one of the boys of the family Miranda lives with today. His task was to utilize simple machines to design and build a solution to a problem, and then document that process. 

Side note: Why is school so much cooler nowadays?

So while initially we had thought up a creative way to lift a bag of tea out of a mug using some simple machines, our building process took several different turns. Eventually, we turned to the trusty Lego brick as the source of our ability to craft the structure that would hold our contraption, and in quick order we were finished with the project and able to continue on with our days. Furthermore, several other kids were becoming more interested in the project, and lent their creativity to the situation, making it more of a collaborative effort than simply filling out a worksheet or answering a packet of questions about how simple machines work.

Again, these kids have no idea how cool they've got it.

So we finally built the machine and got everything calibrated in order to utilize a lever and a pully to lift a bag of tea out of a mug. I wish I had taken the opportunity to grab a picture, but alas I did not. Nevertheless, it was cool to see, and help this kid better understand what it takes to flex his creativity.

So too has been this project whereby I'm attempting to call upon my own creativity pretty frequently, the idea being that eventually this will get easier. And it will, so long as I continue to keep up with it. 

Like several of my college roommates said "You can't skip leg day."
