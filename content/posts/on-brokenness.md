{Today Miranda played me this song  
While we drove in the car  
Back from the mall.  

My mind drifted  
Back to all those days  
Where I slept in desolate battlefields  
Where neither army won.  

I couldn't help but think  
That perhaps my days are not meant to linger  
In this hard, compacted earth  
Where boots stamped the dirt  
And life refused to grow  

Perhaps maybe,  
My life is destined for something better  
Something brighter  
Maybe the boots get replaced with sandals  
And our swords with plowshares  
To bring life back to the fallow ground  

The terrain of my heart  
Once dusty from being trampled upon.  
Water rises from the depths  
Tears flow above and below  
Nursing spring back into it's calling.  

My mind drifts  
Towards the hope of tomorrow  
Where My Sunflower may dance  
And shine her face towards the sun  

Miranda played me this song today  
And though it brought tears  
I couldn't be more greatful}
