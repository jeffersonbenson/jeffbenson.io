I think for me some of the hardest topics to discuss involve emotions. Not so much the science of emotions, but how I think and feel. It sometimes feels like I'm speaking a foreign language, or attempting to communicate with a very different culture.

It is in these moments that I am reminded of how unique each individual human being is. I'm reminded how the God of the Universe cares for and understands every single person that has ever existed, and is intimately familiar with their emotions. It is also in these moments that I can feel very small, because I am lacking in this field of communication, yet am required to do so as a part of further growth. It's not that I don't want to talk about my emotions, but it all becomes very fuzzy, and sometimes I panic because either I don't have the words to say it, or my mind has simply come to a complete blank for lack of a better thought. 

Or worse yet, that I might become embarassed by what I actually feel. 

Jordan Peterson talks about (or rather [sings](https://open.spotify.com/track/6aacMsUjLORCfTIkmGyHYg?si=T4V5h7tNR7aeFTTUqkAj4g)) describes how when we are in the process of cleaning our room, we find that weare often stumbling over ourselves because if we suppose that we desire to hang some art on a wall, we have to contend with what good art is, which means we need to develop taste. And developing taste means that we have to understand that maybe someone won't like our taste, and find it laughable, which means that we either need to build resilience to those who might disagree, or refine our taste because as it turns out, we're still trying to figure this out. 

I feel the same way about talking about my emotions. Often if I'm asked how I'm feeling about a circumstance, or what my feelings are about a subject, I either stumble towards a series of canned responses, or sit their blankly because my brain can't seem to muster up what I'm actually feeling. It's not apathy per say, but rather I often feel things without being fully conscious of it. This can lead to some very problematic circumstances, because my inability to talk about my emotions either backfires, or has the appearance that I don't care.

But I am a person in process. And while I am becoming, I am learning to be more willing to make mistakes. I desire to be okay with failure, and understand that I am in no way required to be perfect in my efforts. My hope is to continue this habit forward, and slowly, maybe without even realizing it, become better at understanding myself and those around me.
