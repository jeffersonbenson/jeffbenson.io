Today was a good day to be partially Irish as well as Scottish. There are not often days in the year that a late 20s white anglo-saxon can celebrate a particular level of pride in his heritage, but today was one of those days. We started off by gathering with several friends at a local brewery just up the road for lunch and drinks and good conversation, followed by a tour of a nearby distillery, where there was a ton to learn about the production of whiskey as well as enjoy the fruits of their labor. 

It's not often that I find myself in a place where it's almost exclusively adults, but a distillery is definitely one of those places. There, we learned about how while sometimes a single malt is a sinuglar expression of the barley used to make it, a consistent batch process might come from multiple different batches and is carefully blended to ultimately make the final flavor profile. After Miranda and I both shared our flights and enjoyed the conversation with friends, it was time to carry on back into town where I would determine what to do with the rest of my day. Not sure what to make of it, I attempted in vain to rest on my one day where I am not beholden to any requirement. Seeing this I grabbed my rough bow-shaped object and returned to Vector Space where I could take some time to sand in peace and not contemplate the further spread of any sort of viral outbreak. 

However, much to my pleasure did several other friends invite me over for Shepherd's Pie and more drinks. This was not for any sort of birthday celebration, as the previous festivities were, but rather to celebrate an early St. Patrick's day, which is one of the few times I seek to embrace my Irish side. Not that I have anything against that part of my heritage, it's just not often I get to flex it. 

I found myself today in various social situations and with a wide variety of people, and I felt so at home with all of them. I tend to show different facets of myself when I am around particular people, possibly for their sake, and possibly for my own. Nevertheless, I am still me at all times, though the expression might look a tad different.

I've had a few conversations this weekend bringing back up the Enneagram and it's pursuit of self-discovery. I only read a bit on the subject back when it was in vogue, but perhaps if this renaissance is to continue, I shall have to pursue my research further. Maybe it can help to explain why I do or think certain ways, and help to unlock some of the mystery found within self-expression, which I am still seeking to better understand.
