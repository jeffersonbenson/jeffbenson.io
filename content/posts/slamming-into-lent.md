So today marks the opening day of a series I want to write about for Lent. They say in church tradition, there are two kinds to things one can do as part of their reflection on Christ. The first is they may give up something, which is often what one will think of when they think of the Lenten season. The second, however, requires that someone take up something extra as a means to undergo further transformation into the likeness of Christ. 

For me, writing has always been a passion project. In addition to being a musician, I've tried other forms of art as a means of self-expression, and though I have been known to doodle occasionally, I regret to say that I can barely draw a straight line (and there are many pages of my attempts). Since I was in 10th grade I've had the process of journaling down pretty well, though in my college days that practice has since slipped. Therefore, I'm hoping to spark something new again in myself, whereby I can continue to have a place to reflect on my days. It just so happens that the inclusion of the Lenten season is a convenient opportunity to hone my skills by writing at least something over the next 40 days, with the exception of Sundays.

I shudder at the thought that this could be misconstrued as some sort of "Christian New Year's Resolution" whereby I am struggling to attain some sort of earthly version of self-improvement. Though I find that there is nothing inherently bad about desiring self-improvement, I am trying to use this as a method of reflection on how the Lord is continuing to bless me in the midst of my own self-loathing. 

Take today for example. Though I would love to say that all parts of my day were fantastic, there were several occasions where things were downright frustrating. At work there are several projects I'm involved in where a severe case of miscommunication has crept into our ranks, and has made accomplishing several tasks rather difficult. My hope is that by tomorrow there will be some things cleared up. Also it appears tomorrow will be a more steady day as far as work culture is concerned, so the prospect of those things has kept me sane.

As a result of my aforementioned bellyaching, I found myself very abruptly at the Ash Wednesday service at my church this evening. It was only after the imposition of Ashes and the phrase 'remember you are dust, and to dust you shall return' was spoken that I finally found my heart able to quiet and my mind to come to a place of rest. Perhaps Miranda was right, I was deep in overstimulation-mode and as a result could not function well until I had some time to pause and gather myself for a bit. 

Though I feel like my forehead has slammed into Lent, may the mark left be more than just oily ashes, but rather a mark on my soul to remember to take time to rest, and understand that I don't need to always keep pushing.
