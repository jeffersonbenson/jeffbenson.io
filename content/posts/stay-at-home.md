So in part because the current advice is to stay at home when possible and in part because I felt I needed a break, today was Stay at Home Saturdays (TM) with Jeff Benson.

I also got Animal Crossing: New Horizons (not pictured above), so much of my afternoon was spent playing that. So far it's super fun and I'm looking forward to playing more as the days continue, since the game moves in real time and actually requires that I wait in order for cool stuff to happen. 

Before that though I spent much of my morning cleaning the kitchen and seasoning my roommate's cast iron pan, since it was starting to look a bit sad. I followed [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDTCgxvmShc&t=292s) from Joshua Weissman and it looks really good. I might do a third coat of oil tomorrow just to make it shine better, but we'll see. I did also vacuum as much of the downstairs as I could, since the dust was starting to become a bit obvious. 

My evening was spent with a combination of more Animal Crossing, playing Pathfinder with some friends, and reading [Handle with Care](https://www.amazon.com/Handle-Care-Jesus-Redeems-Ministry/dp/153596233X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=handle+with+care+book&qid=1584849335&sr=8-1) as a part of me trying to become a more avid reader. So far I'm averaging a chapter a day, which is right about where I want to be at this point. My hope is that I'll be able to digest books at a faster pace going forward, but right now a chapter a day seems like a reasonable pace. 

Overall, despite governing authorities instructing us to stay at home today, I feel like I did my best to keep myself busy. Not unnecessarily so, but just enough so that I didn't end up sitting with not to do, which would not spell well for my mental health. My hope is that tomorrow I'll be able to do more things of this nature, or at least have more ideas of ways to quarantine against any sort of potentially infectious disease.
