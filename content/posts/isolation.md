One of the common practices that's been going around the news is that of self-isolation. Combined with social distancing, these measures are supposed to help curb the spread of the virus. What that also means is that individuals like myself who thrive on being able to be in contact with others need to get creative in order to fulfill our need for anything other than my house. All that to say, Miranda and I walked in the woods today. 

There's this trail near her house that runs a pretty decent way back alongside a small river, and aside from a few neighbors the entire trail walk is very peaceful. I think for both of us it's a good opportunity to clear our heads and talk about what we think about certain topics. We heard today that gathering over 100 people are banned by the Governor, and while that might be a tad hard to enforce, it does speak to the rising concern that a lot of people are feeling regarding the spread of the virus. The reports are sayting that this could continue well into the summer even if we do what we must to curb infection rates.

Mostly I think right now I'm concerned with how this is going to impact businesses and individuals who depend on foot traffic. It's going to take a while even after infection rates slow down for all of this to recover, if it even does at all. I don't think things are at panic levels yet, as we're trying to maintain a level of normalcy as best we can. But if any amount of the reports from last week are to be believed, I think we've still got a long way to go before things start to return to normal.

Addendum: While writing this post, I accidentally placed it in it's own form of isolation, in a completely unrelated folder (ha)
