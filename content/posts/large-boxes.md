As I am writing this post, I am reminded that I am very sore as a result of today. After work I was asked to help move a friend and his family into a new house after driving all the way from Colorado. Happy to oblige I said I would help as best I could, and drove to my friend and his family's new abode where about a 20' box truck was there filled to the brim with boxes and furniture. I should mention at this point my friend has 3 children and is a fan of all things outdoors. Therefore, in addition to the things a typical moving truck would have, this one also includes pieces of rock climbing gear, mountain biking gear, kayaking gear, you get the point.

Needless to say, I am sore in several places this evening. Apart from myself and my friend, three other strong men helped unload that truck to the best of our ability, and I am happy to report the truck is finally empty and all the boxes and furniture and outdoors supplies is now safely stored in the house, waiting to be unpacked. 

There is something about hard work that bonds men together better than any social mixer ever could do. Rather than speak about who we are or what we do, I believe many men would rather work on something collaboratively with others, building friendships along the way and taking the opportunity to show off their character and skillset. This is how we bond and actually the fastest way to get men to understand one another. 

After the last box was brought in and some final arranging was done, we toasted the evening with some scotch, another way which men over the ages have bonded together. We took the opportunity to celebrate our accomplishment of slowly chipping away at this mountain of things, and getting them to the appropriate room inside a house with many tight corners. 

We do celebrate, and we also take the opportunity to recover. I know for a fact I will be quite sore in the morning, but the pride I feel in what we accomplished at least makes it somewhat worth it.
