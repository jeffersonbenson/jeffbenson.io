These past few days (or rather, since the start of this blog) there have been a lot of serious discussions. What I mean to say is both inside this blog as well as in our surrounding community, there have been many serious disucssions had. And while I don't shy away from such conversation, it needs to be balanced with something a bit lighter also. If the weather the past day or so has taught me anything, it's that a bit of sunshine can do a body and a mind good. 
I've had a few things rattling around in my mind over the past few days, I think today I'm just going to share them out, in no particular order.

I've been musing on what happens when Christians try to interract with the mainstream media, and how it always seems that attempts to interract with the mainstream backfire horribly, leaving one with a wrecked faith or worse, a deep wound to the faith of others. See [this article](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/rhett-link-deconversion/) from the Gospel Coalition for more into what's been on my mind.

I've been wanting to get back into the process of making bows for a few weeks now. This is to say the art of taking wood and crafting it and hewing it down to something workable and flexible. Ultimately, I'd really like to be able to take a handmade bow into the woods for hunting. Ultimately, I want to understand the process from start to finish of how we eat meat via hunting, starting with the bow and working to knives and meat preparation techniques. Really I think that'll just be an excuse to have the tastiest, hardest-earned steak I've had. 
Behind me is what I think (and what I've [researched to be](http://poorfolkbows.com/oak.htm)) the most perfect piece of red oak for bow making. The long, straight grain lines and thick growth rings check all the boxes for bowyering. Hopefully, I'll get the opportunity to begin marking out the bow and beginning to carve it soon enough.

I mentioned it a few weeks ago, but I've been wanting to get back into ham radio for some time now (callsign KB3TVP just in case you were wondering). It just so happens that with the recent media alarm of viral outbreaks, it's a great time to do some preparedness, including understanding how to communicate in the event of a cell tower overload. I have been in such unfortunate situations before, where there are so many people in a given area that the density all but knocks out communication. Plus there are some cool science and hacker-type projects I've been meaning to try, and the ham radio is just one piece of that puzzle.

I bought a pair of wireless earbuds yesterday as an early birthday present to myself. I am amazed how I didn't have these sooner. I love the freedom that not having a cable affords. Even with needing to keep a charge, I'm a big fan.

Random? Yes it is. But overall I'm trying to seek balance in both heavy and lighter pieces of my life. Otherwise, I could become overwhelmed by either, and that is simply not a good way to live. 

Anyways, until tomorrow!
