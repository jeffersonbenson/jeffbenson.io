Yesterday I had to swing by the grocery store, since I was out of almond milk. I decided that it would be best to go at night when the foot traffic is low, because even if there is no real threat of the virus spreading in this town, the threat of human hysteria is very much real. So I walked into the store, being greeted by a woman that said the store would be closing soon, presumably for sanitation purposes. Anyway in haste I walked directly to where I knew the almond milk was, which just so happened to be also where the dry snacks are, such as banana chips and various forms of trail mix. There's also wasabi peas, which are among my favorite of the dried goods, so I decided that I would get some for later munching that evening, since I was feeling a tad peckish.

I returned home with the wasabi peas delighted with my purchase, along with the necessary almond milk. I then proceeded to relax on my couch and snack on these wasabi peas enthusiastically.

It was at that moment, I realized my error.

I could feel the fire from the peas flood my sinuses, and remind me that in no uncertain terms should I rush into a jar of wasabi peas. Instead, I need to be slow and methodical, lest I burn myself in the process. 

And though I sometimes feel that I like the burn, overall it's a physical reminder that I need to continue to slow down, and not rush through everything. 

I feel that way today, as I look at how Lent is nearly half over, and the next several weeks of my life have slowed way down. It would not be wise at this point to be out and about, and the news seems to be chaning hourly. In more than one way I am being reminded that I need to continue to slow down, and take in things as they happen, whatever it is that may be happening.

I do genuinely enjoy eating wasabi peas. I just didn't realize that I could learn such a visceral lesson in the process.
