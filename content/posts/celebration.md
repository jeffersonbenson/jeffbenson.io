So yes I didn't post yesterday, which though normally my reaction would be like:

![Sad Porg](https://media.giphy.com/media/3h2lUwrZKilQKbAK6f/giphy.gif "Sad Porg is Sad")

Honestly? I'm more like:

![Relieved](https://media.giphy.com/media/z23hGvopHu7w4/giphy.gif "Relieved")

Because doing a Lenten practice is not like a normal habit, wherein I attempt to make a check on a list that I did the thing I wanted to do today, but rather I'm working to pick myself up from where I was and continue to walk forward with Jesus.

Plus I was at a birthday party.

It a bit of a counter-point to Lent to think of celebration as something we should still be doing. After all, aren't we supposed to be sad about all the sins we've committed over the year?

On the contrary, I believe it was best put by a friend of a friend who was at their first Ash Wednesday service, "for once, I could just be honest with myself". I think too often in Christendom we find it difficult to ourselves as Jesus does, which is to say with pure honesty. 

I think I am often afraid to do most new things not because I could be exposed, but because I could fail. I often inhabit a place of performance-based existence, whereby I need to be perfect in order to achieve something fully. But I can't do that, or at least I can't live like that. Really that could only work for a few things before ultimately falling apart, and leaving me to do nothing. We must be willing to accept failure as part of the process by which we are being formed as we press into Jesus more.

FYI In the spirit of Lent, I am also taking off on Sundays, so while you may be thinking:

Perhaps just go and read something else.
