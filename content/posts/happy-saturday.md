Today has been a Saturday much like most Saturdays, which is to say not much occurred today. I awoke later than I would have liked to find myself lazily going about my day and hanging out with Miranda for the afternoon while she worked on school and I caught up in my book. Riveting I know.

All the same, there isn't much more that can be reported on, as if I would rather say that I spent my day wrestling a bear or writing the great American novel. I feel that today wasn't certainly terrible, but it doesn't feel particularly valuable either. Inasmuch as I recognize that every day is a gift and should be cherished, I certainly have the feeling that much like the sky we gazed upon at night, the bright spots were a bit covered. 

Tomorrow we will have church online again. The pastor who's house Miranda lives in will be preaching tomorrow, which will be a rather odd feeling. Not only because I will be one of a very small audience present to a service conducted via Facebook, but also because the majority of it will be my priest looking into a webcam, whilst his family and I look upon him leading in prayers and preaching. It's curious what that says about the nature of livestreaming events, as it does beg the question 'who is the audience'. 

Nevertheless, I am hopeful for tomorrow, and that a good night's rest will coax a better (or at least more interesting) day into becoming.
