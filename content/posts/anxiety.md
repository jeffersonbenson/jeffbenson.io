Before I go any further, let me just say this is not another hot take on the potential outcomes of the current COVID-19 pandemic. This is also not me stating that I'm becoming anxious over what I'm being told is a massive viral outbreak. This is also not me say I've stocked up on toilet paper (though I may have bought some yesterday out of...ahem...necessity).

No, rather what I'm most intrigued in is how it seems the media presence of this viral outbreak and the panic created by it is spreading faster than the actual virus itself. I have received an email from practically every company I've ever interracted with describing how they are embracing new sanitization standards or contributing towards some fund for effected persons. And while all these things are good, there's an underbelly of fear that I think is quickly gripping our people local and global. 

Almost every major event I or someone in my family was planning to go be a part of has been postponed until further notice. Many of the people I know who are in school are facing the harsh reality that things might be changing for them in the coming weeks. Even still, I'm currently in a position where I'm starting to consider what to do in the event I have to be under the regime of a lockdown for a period of time. In short, the anxiety caused by this pandemic is mounting, and it seems impossible to escape.

I would genuinely just like to turn it off and back away for a while, but more and more it seems that the 24-hour news cycle we live with is finally making it known that we are subject to the power of the news. And that does not always mean a massive corporation spending billions on targeted advertising. Rather, it can even be as simple as the spreading of a message from one person to another, which at this point is how I prefer to receive my news updates. At least then the comments can remain civil.

Amidst all of this, let's be thankful that spring is coming. I think we could all use a little warm weather for a change.
