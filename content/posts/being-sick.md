So if the title wasn't obvious, I fear that I may be coming down with some sort of illness impacting my head, throat, and sinuses. As such I shall attempt to keep this brief. 

It is a curious thing, not feeling well in the modern era. An entire epoch of modern medical discoveries, and the best advice I can get is to rest and recover. Not that this is a bad thing; I like sleeping as much as anyone else. And I am grateful that there exist new medications that can help to alievate my symptoms and at least be a balm to my body. Either way, I am looking forward to feeling like my usual self again.

On a completely unrelated note, it often still blows my mind about how fantastic the blessings of the Lord are. If you were to talk to me a year or more ago, I would bemoan and sometimes become rather agitated that things did not occur in my timing, and that God should adjust His clock to fit my desires. Of course now here I am with more than I bargained for, and each time I look back I can't understand why, but I am still all the more grateful.

So I guess the similarity there is that though in the present moment things may seem bad, through illness or some other circumstances, the rhythm of the Lord is a constant heartbeat that longs for your good. As our Good Father and Shepherd, the Lord works out His timing despite what we think it needs to be. If only one were to hold on just a bit longer, they would be amazed at how much blessings flow forth, particularly on the other side of being in a low spot.
