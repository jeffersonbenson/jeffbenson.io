> He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; 
> Isaiah 53:3a (English Standard Version)

This evening Miranda and I watched *A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood*, a film in which a cynical reporter named Lloyd is tasked with interviewing Mr. Fred Rogers, who begins to develop a friendship with the reporter. The kindness Mr. Rogers demonstrates towards Lloyd helps him to cope with some of the hurts of his past, and help him to begin to mend some very broken relationships. 

Suffice it to say, this movie struck a chord with me, and in between the many moments of tears, I began to notice something very interesting unfold. Though Mr. Rogers himself (to the best of my knowledge) have the same story as Lloyd, there was enough compassion there to at least help Lloyd understand that he is allowed to feel his own emotions. Much more, during the course of the film, Mr. Rogers notes that the purpose of his program is to help children deal with their emotions, though conversation, imagination, and song.

It was during all this that I was reminded of the comfort of how Jesus sits with us in our sorrow and grief. Theologians for centuries have struggled through how Jesus can both know why something is happening and yet still be sad, many coming to very extreme conclusions (I'm looking at you hard determinists). But we do know that regardless of that, Jesus does weep when we weep. He is familiar with our pain, because he is experiencing it with us as we grieve. Much in the same way, even if I am not acquainted with a person's grief like Jesus, I ought to still learn to sit in the discomfort of grief, and be a prayerful presence with them, an uncomfortable but worthy prospect. 

I was pondering all this on my silent drive home, but also another thought came to mind. How beautiful is it when someone is acquainted with our grief. Like if I've been through an experience before, or suffered the same affliction as someone else, how much more can I be compassionate to them. Sure it's a familiar wound, but it is one that displays the tapestry of our lives, and tapestries are meant to be on display. They show how we became who we are, and if we have overcome something, it is not to be shuttered away as if it's not worthy of being on display in the gallery of our communities.

It is a beautiful thing to be able to compare scars with someone else, not as a game of who was hurt worse, but to tell the story of how it went from wound to scar. How the Healer of our souls washed our wounds and allowed them to heal, bringing wholeness back to where there was once separation. But leaving behind the story, for us and for our neighbors.
