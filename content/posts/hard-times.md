Today has been a bit of a challenge. Apart from being pulled in seemingly every conceivable direction at work, I had to have several hard conversations today. Not bad ones mind you, just hard because they involve people I care very deply about. Conversations like this do not come about as the result of spite or malice, or any other kind of angry remark. Rather though, they come out of a place of conviction and a desire to connect and communicate clearly. 

Nevertheless, conversations like that take a lot out of me. And I'm still rather weary from all those moving boxes yesterday, so even physically I'm tired. But I'm enjoying my evening in comfortable pajamas, a small glass of beer, and my computer gently warming my feet as it folds proteins looking for cures to COVID-19 or any other of a selection of horrible maladies ([link](foldingathome.org)). I look forward to this time nearly everyy evening, where I can write and gather my thoughts, but tonight especially I am grateful to be able to sit and pause to better understand the way my day has gone. 

Which is also why I look forward to the time after this post is published, where I can rest and finish the bottom half of my beer glass while watching YouTube videos. I'd rather spend my evenings coasting than with an abrupt stop almost any day if I can help it.
