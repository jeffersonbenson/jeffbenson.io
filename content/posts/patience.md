I think for me this year one of the hardest lessons I'm learning is patience. Like there's a part of me that just wants certain things to come to pass, or just to advance past a particular part of my life, be it a busy work day or a week that's jam packed with meetings. Regardless, I am often an impatient person even with respect to things I particularly enjoy. I find myself skipping through Youtube videos sifting out what the creator's point is in less time than to watch the actual video. What this really boils down to is my desire to be the master of my own domain.

I was listening to a podcast earlier today (be prepared to hear that phrase more in tthe coming weeks) and both of the speakers were authors who were answering a listener question about how one becomes better at writing, as if one could reach a particular level and then know that they had that skill "in the bag". I was struck by both the hosts' reactions, because both of them agreed that no such point exists. At no point does an author (and by extension any artist) really believe they have reached the pinnacle of the craft, that they have somehow summited the mountain of their own creation. Rather, there is a constant drive which ought to move a writer forward, despite how this writer feels heshould be making more progress than he is making currently. 

But then there's the understanding of how this whole situation came to be. I am learning to be gracious with myself that this is only the ninth day of writing with any consistency in many years. To add to that, this entire blog is written in a method only learned a few days before starting the blog, and the posts are still being typed in a text editor that if it were a human would be well into it's drinking years. 

So I'm learning to be patient with myself in many areas of my life. And as has been the case in the past, the patience will be rewarded. Not even necessarily all at once, but slowly, patiently even, what was sown will be reaped.
