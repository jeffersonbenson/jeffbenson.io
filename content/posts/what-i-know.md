There's a lot I don't know today. I don't know exactly when the sun will rise. I don't really know what the weather will do today. I don't exactly know why my roommate's cat won't stop meowing at me. I can certainly guess at what the answers might be, but they will always remain just that, a guess.

There are at least two different responses I can have to this revelation. On the one hand I can live in complete ignorance and anxiety, worried over what the next bend in the road might look like simply because I can't see it. This kind of lifestyle absolves me from searching deeper, but at the cost of a gripping fear that paralyzes me from decision.

On the other hand, I can understand that there is a fathomless mystery surrounding what is going on around me, and that ultimately though I can't know how every blade of grass will turn, I can certainly know the One who causes the wind to blow. And this isn't some kind of stoic optimism about my circumstances, rather it is the mindful awareness that there is confidence to be had in the One who continues to remain in control.

So it's not a bother to me if things are starting to become unclear, I don't need to know what lies ahead anyway. Rather, my place is to focus on the present moment with those around me, and to drink in the peace that is found in the silence and the unknowing. And probably giving the cat chin-scratches more to calm the meowing.
