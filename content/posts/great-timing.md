Earlier today while on a group call, one of my friends remarked how amazing it was that we would all live in such a time as this to be able to have group voice calls (with video even), and how radically that has changed the way that people are coping with the current pandemic. I had to agree with him, thinking about how if this were only a few years ago we would not be able to have these kinds of conversations, where I was on my phone while others were on laptops, and still others on tablet devices. 

Born out of the business world, the ability to stand up quick 'meeting rooms' for virtual business meetings has become a popular trend in the past 5 years, branching out even as large chat-room-type software such as Slack and Discord are growing for their own particular reasons. What is most fascinating to me is the stories I'm hearing of people using these rapidly deployable virtual spaces in such creative ways. Families and friend groups that normally wouldn't be able to connect with one another are now hosting "dinner parties" where they can simply have an open line of communication with one another. Still others are leveraging similar services to host "watch parties" where people can co-habitate a virtual space, yet still remain in their respective spaces. 

Though not the VR fantasy I was promised, I do have to admire the creativity that certain communities are demonstrating as we still seek to connect with one another despite remaining in our own homes. One such key piece of this is social gathering tools that are being borrowed from corporations for "after-hours" uses, that will only continue to develop inyo more interesting solutions in the forthcoming days. Pretty great timing for anyone like myself trying to find solutions to the problems of isolation in these current days. Pretty great timing indeed.
