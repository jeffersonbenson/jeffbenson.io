So I'm still sick today, which means as I'm writing this at the close of my day I am seriously looking forward to my bed. I am also looking forward to not being sick any more, but then again maybe I'm just not that good at being a sick person (as if anyone is). 

This evening, Miranda was keen to tell me that if I'm not feeling well tomorrow then I should take some time to rest because my body is asking for rest. That for me might be one of the single greatest challenges that I'm facing currenlty. More than just being sick, I often am at odds with myself when I am disquieted or disrupted from my normal routine. I tell myself if I just let this pass, if I just wait for the storm to pass, then everything will go back to normal. I convince myself that I don't need to do anything to change a situation, except to sit quietly and wait it out.

But sometimes I can't just wait it out. My human limitations prevent me from being able to simply take every strike and storm that rage against me. I desire to be able to see that I need a change in my rhythm and that one of the best things that I can do is to allow for something like rest to become more integrated into my life.

In short, I desire to be interrupted more by rest.

Really this could be taken two ways, on one hand I'm interrupted by rest when I fall asleep on the couch.

Which is not so much me being interrupted by rest as me literally passing out from exhaustion. 

Rather, I mean that I desire to be not inconvenienced by the fact that my body needs rest. Or at least that I need to sometimes it's not always about hitting a bottom line. Maybe the healthiest thing I can do, so that I can "live to fight another day", is to stop and rest.
